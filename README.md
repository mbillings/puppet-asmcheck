Queries Oracle's ASM page for updated packages

This is specifically for RHEL5 64-bit ASM packages. Eventually it will be expanded.

While Puppet's parameterized variables are great, I like to assign these to local variables for ease of typing, readability, and less Puppet overhead.

Also, Github's repo name suggestion was "drunken-octo-robot". It knows me so well.

Anecdote if you're still reading this: I once did a Google search for "Is there an opposite", to which the third auto-complete result was "to absolute zero?", which is exactly what I was going to search. Pretty soon we won't even need to type.
